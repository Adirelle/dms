* Reintegrate ffprobe error suppression into the ffmpeg.Probe function
* Move ./dlna/dms somewhere more appropriate. It's moreof a DMS than a DLNADMS now.
* Fix seeking for transcodes. Should be broken.
* DMS handler path /icon should be /thumbnail, and /deviceIcon->/icon, or something like that.
* Work around lack of ffmpegthumbnailer on Windows.
